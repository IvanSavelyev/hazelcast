This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.0.6 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

## Enhancements

* Added the support of partition grouping mechanism in the Hazelcast discovery plugin for Kubernetes.
You can create partition groups according to the name of the node which is provided by this
plugin and on which the containers/pods run. See the `NODE_AWARE` section of https://docs.hazelcast.com/imdg/4.0/clusters/partition-group-configuration#node-aware-partition-grouping. [#17913]
* Added protection against XML External Entity attacks (XXE). [#17753]
* Introduced a configuration property to ignore errors during enabling the XXE protection.
This protection works with JAXP 1.5 (Java 7 Update 40) and newer. When an older JAXP
implementation is added to the classpath, e.g., Xerces and Xalan, an exception is thrown.
The newly introduced property, namely `hazelcast.ignoreXxeProtectionFailures`, allows you to ignore those exceptions.
See https://docs.hazelcast.com/imdg/4/system-properties for more information. [#17869]
* Updated log4j2 dependency version to 2.17.0 in Hazelcast’s root `pom.xml`. [#20161]
* Updated the Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin dependency version to 2.2.2. [#18330]

## Fixes

* Hazelcast’s memcached implementation was interpreting the number values and parameters for
`incr` and `decr` wrongly (numbers were being converted into byte arrays instead of decimals).
This has been fixed by making these commands' implementations strictly follow the memcached protocol specification. [#19680]
* Fixed an issue where the client state listener was not properly working with
failover clients (in blue-green deployments); it was failing with invalid configuration exception. [#19117]
* There was a discrepancy between index-scan and full-scan. The definition of
"touching an entry" was different between these two scans, while index-scan shifts expiry time, full-scan doesn’t.
This behavior of index-scan and full-scan from the perspective of expiry-time shifting has been fixed:
  ** Expired entries for both index-scan and full-scan are not shown now.
  ** These scans now are not counted as "touching an entry" so no expiry time shifting happens. [#18347]
* Fixed an issue where the Java client was not receiving membership
events when a member with Hot Restart Persistence enabled is restarted. [#18269]
* The `-c` parameter of the `cp-subsystem.sh` script was used for both
cluster name and group variables. This has been fixed by introducing the `-g` parameter for groups. [#18149]
* Fixed the `DelegatingCompletableFuture` and the `ClientDelegatingFuture` subclass behavior
when `HazelcastSerializationException` is thrown:
  ** Serialization exception is now properly wrapped in `(Execution|Completion)Exception`
  when thrown from `get`, `getNow` or `join` methods.
  ** `whenComplete`, `handle` and `exceptionally` can act on `HazelcastSerializationException`. [#18140]
* Fixed an issue where data was being lost from maps in the event of a member failure in a 3-member cluster with backup count set to `1`.
This was occurring when lite members are promoted to be data members. [#17757]
* Fixed an issue where the service URL for Eureka could not be set using the declarative configuration. [#17744]
* When the user code deployment is used and the classes to be deployed have
`com.hazelcast` prefix, it was causing failures in other Hazelcast products, e.g., Jet.
This has been fixed by making use of the context classloader when loading such classes. [#17584]
* Fixed an issue where the user code deployment feature was failing to work for
inner-classes when not all the members have the user provided class on their classpaths. [#17576]
* Fixed an issue where Hazelcast was failing to load the configuration file
(`hazelcast.xml` or user-provided files) from the classpath when in development mode for
frameworks such as Quarkus. [#17538]

## Removed/Deprecated Features

* The following properties have been deprecated:
  ** `hazelcast.client.statistics.enabled`
  ** `hazelcast.client.statistics.period.seconds`
  [#19235]
